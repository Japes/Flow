Make the monk hover
	using the current pos, theres a story to it, chakras, hover, etc
	background images

red/evil buttons you're not supposed to hit
boxes appear off the edge of your buttons - you need to figure out that you can press the next button

"hold-down" buttons
big one in the center - two middle buttons

SOUND
	music for programming episode 35 36:23 (time remaining)
		twinkly synth notes and a weird distorted high pitched chant
	tones for key presses and hits



Hands up mode
	combo?

more interesting patterns
	waves	


distraction rectangles that fly up or sideways?

THE STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS--- looping, reincarnation.  you start at the bottom again

    heaven(s) - abstract tie die
    up into space - galaxies
    the sky above the top of the mountain
    chakras rising
        somewhere between here and the top we need a "woah" thing like the new buttons
    the monk in the monastary
    the mountain
    the city (traffic, noise)
        interesting idle things going on
    hell (demons, suffering souls)
        lots of distractions and noise
        maybe lots of red avoid blocks

ok so if you care, there is a one-liner fix for it
change line 45 of `fallingBoxesLayer.py` to
        `self.__bps_granularity = 8.0 #beats per second`
