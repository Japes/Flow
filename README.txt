A meditation simulator by Jean-Paul da Conceicao (jpdacon@gmail.com)
Made for pyweek 26 in October 2018 (https://pyweek.org/)

==Instructions==
Hopefully the game is self-explanatory for the most part - hit the falling circles at the right moment (a la guitar-hero), 
and help your monk ascend to higher levels of spiritual awareness!

==Installation==

The game needs python3 and the cocos2d module installed.  Instructions for how to do this below.
Please let me know if you have any issues getting it to work!

Linux (tested on ubuntu)
 - Python 3 (tested with python 3.5.2 )
   - "sudo apt install python3" or similar...
 - python modules:
   - easiest to set up with pip ("sudo apt install python3-pip" or similar...). Then:
   - "pip install pygame --user"
   - "pip install cocos2d --user"
 - run "flow.py" with python to start the game!

Windows
 - Python 3 (tested with 3.6.5)
 - pygame ("pip install pygame")
 - cocos2d ("pip install cocos2d")
 - run "flow.py" with python to start the game!
